# Tablesmith

Drop-in gem for console tables for Hash, Array and ActiveRecord.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tablesmith'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tablesmith

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Why Not #{other_gem}?

Happy to learn about something else already out there, but have struggled to find something
that doesn't require some sort of setup. I want drop-in ready-to-go table output for Hashes,
Arrays and ActiveRecord objects.

Here's a quick list of other gems that I've tried out that are awesome and do much more than what Tablesmith does,
but don't seem to specialize in what I want:

  - Hirb
  - text-table
  - table_print
  - awesome_print
  - [tabulo](https://github.com/matt-harvey/tabulo)
